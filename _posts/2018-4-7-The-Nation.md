## Introduction
![alt text](https://naponjatusripitak.github.io/polisci490/Project/thenation.png)
Do newspaper articles that are published before and after the occurrence of a regime transition differ systematically in terms of their topic coverage and content? Utilizing an original dataset containing all political news published from 2013 to 2015 by _The Nation_, an English-language daily newspaper in Thailand, this project explores the relationship between regime transition and the media. Specifically, I analyze Thai newspaper articles that were published under democratic rule (pre-May 2014 coup) and those that were published under military rule (post-May 2014 coup), using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to examine topic variation amidst a regime transition. Then, leveraging the topics generated by the model, I conduct a series of quantitative content analyses for assessing the frequencies of words and measuring the sentiments associated with a given topic over time.

## Data Collection and Pre-Processing
All newspaper articles published by The Nation from 2013 to 2015 were collected from the Nexis Uni database via Rselenium, which extracted relevant information such as the headline, content, and date. The search query used in this process of data collection is _thailand_. For the analysis, only articles that contain a set of keywords that are predictive of their political content were retained for the analysis. These keywords include: politic*, gov*, democ*, Yingluck, junta, Prayut, Pheu, and NCPO. One problem with this strategy is that the keyword selection process is potentially arbitrary, inadequate for minimizing false positives and lacking in terms of intercoder reliability. An alternative strategy would be to use a computer-assisted approach offered by King, Lam and Roberts (2017), relying on an unsupervised selection of documents in search set, _S_, into target set, _T_, based on a hand-coded reference set _R_. However, in this project, the dictionary-based approach is selected for computational efficiency. This process yields a total of 20,703 articles where the average length is 580 words.

The National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission will press ahead with its planned auction of 1,800MHz and 900MHz spectrum licences this year in the belief it will help shore up the sagging economy.
"The Telecom Committee will go ahead with every project, especially the plan to auction both 1,800MHz and 900MHz licences," Settapong Malisuwan, chairman of the committee, said last week.
The policy has also been given the blessing of the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council, he said. The coup makes no difference at all on the planned auction.
About Bt100 billion would be paid upfront by the bid winners for the licences alone and more investment would follow.
Many local and foreign investors have asked for the auction details. The NBTC will auction two 1,800MHz licences in August and two 900MHz licences in November.
Fitch Ratings expects to revise down its forecast of 2.5-per-cent growth for the economy on the back of the continuing political uncertainty and weak first-quarter data showing that the economy contracted by 0.6 per cent on year.
The National Economic and Social Development Board recently lowered its 2014 GDP growth forecast to 1.5-2.5 per cent from 3-4 per cent that it made in February.
Wichian Mektrakarn, CEO of Advanced Info Service (AIS), also said the licensing would be good for the economy. The NBTC is expected to see upfront licence payments of at least Bt50 billion for the licences.
AIS is keen to bid for both 1,800MHz and 900MHz licences and wants to acquire at least 20MHz bandwidth to enhance its wireless broadband business.
AIS is using the 900MHz frequency under a concession from TOT that expires next year. Its subsidiary Advanced Wireless Network is one of the three 2.1GHz spectrum licence holders.
AIS wants more airspace to serve its 42 million customers.
AIS might consider adjusting its revenue growth guidance again in the middle of the year.
"Our growth goes hand-in-hand with GDP. This year we expect to see 6-8-per-cent revenue growth, the same as last year, if GDP growth is at 4 per cent. If GDP is changed, we'll adjust our revenue forecast again," he said.
In its recent filing to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, AIS said it was keeping its 2014 revenue growth target at 6-8 per cent. It expects growth to pick up in the second half of this year, underpinned by its decent 3G-network quality and coverage.

The National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) yesterday assured key economic agencies and leading private organisations that it would allow all economic activities to continue without interruption and it would also consider measures to stimulate the country's growth.
NCPO deputy spokesman Nattawat Chancharoen said the meeting, led by Army chief General Prayut Chan-ocha and Air Chief Marshal Prajin Juntong, had ordered concerned agencies to arrange funds for paying the Bt92 billion overdue debt to farmers within a month. Farmers should start to get payment within two days. The NCPO also ordered all involved agencies to submit progress reports to the NCPO.
As an urgent measure, the NCPO will also approve budget disbursement for the 2014-15 fiscal year, which is scheduled to start in October this year.
Sources at the meeting said that other issues discussed included promoting economic growth following the upcoming Asean Economic Community, enhance cross-border trade, set up a Board of Investment committee, and discuss value-added tax and corporate tax to ensure business growth.
Somchart Soithong, director-general at the Internal Trade Department, said that the Army chief had ordered the Commerce Ministry to pay rice farmers their dues within a month. The funding source is not a problem any longer because the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives has already provided from its own reserves Bt40 billion, while the Finance Ministry has been ordered to find the balance Bt50 billion from financial institutions to pay dues to about 800,000 farmers.
Somchart said that the NCPO had ordered the ministry to find measures to help increase farmers incomes, but not intervene in the market mechanism. It also allowed the ministry to continue its rice-stock release plans if the price is acceptable.
The NCPO also encouraged the ministry to promote export growth and boost foreign investor confidence.
Bank of Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said after his meeting with the NCPO that the council had urged all economic agencies to report on the development of the economy. He said the NCPO urged the economic institutions to find ways to stimulate the economy and to maintain normal operations. He said the BOT would today announce its economic plans and details of the meeting that took place yesterday.
Twatchai Yongkittikul, secretary-general of the Thai Bankers Association, said the NCPO told heads of government and private economic institutions to deal with two issues on priority; payment to rice farmers under the pledging scheme, and the government annual budget for 2015.
"The NCPO has told us to continue with our duties and have given us an assignment, which is to stimulate the economy" he said. "I believed that the private sectors are satisfied and confidence after they have talked to the NCPO," he added.
He said short-term investors have most likely lowered their investment in the Kingdom, but the prospects of long-term investors is still unclear and the actual impact of the coup on the market will be visible at the end of the second quarter.
Isara Vongkusolkit, chairman at the Board of Trade, said the council had agreed to work closely with private enterprises to increase foreign investor confidence.
Isara added that the NCPO also concerned on small and medium sized enterprises and orders involved agencies to help promote their businesses.
Supan Mongkolsuthee, president of the Federation of Thai Industries, said the NCPO had told private enterprises that it would promote economic growth and allow economic activities to go on independently. He said the NCPO had also committed to ensure fiscal discipline and promote cross-border trade. Supan added the NCPO was ready to consider tax issues, including maintaining the VAT and reducing business sector's tax burden.
Piyamarn Techapaibul, president of the Tourism Council of Thailand, said the tourism sector has been hit by the coup. The council had proposed exempting curfew in some tourism provinces such as Pattaya, Krabi and Phuket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |Junta says no intention to hinder businesses; says                                                                                                |2014-05-26 |       702|

A pilot project in Singapore to recruit maids from Cambodia is struggling to take off as workers are turned off by high recruitment fees and the fear of not being able to adapt to life here.
Under the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) scheme that began last August, Cambodian maids are, for the first time, allowed to work in Singapore.
The ministry had set a target of 400 maids to arrive by February but only about 200 are in Singapore now, based on figures from the Cambodian Embassy.
This has prompted MOM to push the deadline to August for Cambodian and Singapore agents to bring in all 400 maids.
But even with the extension, agents here are worried that their Cambodian counterparts will not be able to recruit enough workers.
Singapore maid agents blame the high placement fees of 2,400 Singaporean dollars (Bt62,500) that the women pay to Cambodian agents to get jobs in Singapore.
Maid agency Inter-Mares Management Services owner Karl Tan said, "No doubt the maids can earn much more here. But $2,400 is a lot of money to them, as many earn only about $1,000 a year back at home."
Maids earn at least $450 a month here. In contrast, a typical Cambodian factory worker takes home about US$100 (Bt3,260) a month.
High-profile cases of abuse involving Cambodian maids in Malaysia in recent years have also discouraged some of the women from coming here, said agents.
Those cases led to the Cambodian government announcing a temporary ban on maids working in Malaysia in 2011.
This has yet to be lifted.
Cambodian maid recruiter Lao Ly Hock said he finds it difficult to recruit maids who have attended school for at least eight years, which is a requirement set by MOM.
"If the requirement is lowered to five years of education, we would be able to recruit more maids," he said.
The aim of the MOM pilot scheme, which ends next year, is to see if Cambodia workers are suitable for Singapore households, and if the country can be added to the list of approved sources for maids.
Approved source countries and territories for foreign maids in Singapore include Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

CPF is expected to rebound for the rest of the year, thanks to positive factors in its overseas business, which accounts for 58 per cent of its income. Its livestock and aquaculture businesses in Vietnam are projected to continue growing after the livestock oversupply and the EMS shrimp sickness problems have receded.
The livestock business in India is expected to generate strong profit after expansion. CPF's profit in China from CPP, its mainly feed business, is not likely to grow well, so CPP has expanded to be more comprehensive and has invested in the ready-meal business with higher margins. The commercial run will kick off in the fourth quarter.
However, CPP's sales volume is not likely to meet the target, despite the large market and population in China. The competition is fierce and people in each region have their own tastes. CPF's domestic business “ 42 per cent of income “ is expected to recover gradually.
The rebound in its shrimp business might be delayed because shrimp farmers have not been confident about the recovery from EMS. The livestock business was expected to return to normal last quarter. However, as a result of rising raw material costs, its gross margin is expected to fall throughout the year from 13.4 per cent last quarter.
We maintain our fiscal 2014 earnings forecast, expecting net profit not to grow strongly. Smaller volumes of corn and soybean meal products have entered the market as a result of worldwide unfavourable weather for feed production. CPF would suffer from increasing costs because corn and soybean meal make up 40 per cent and 24 per cent of its raw material costs.
Thanks to its inexpensive feed stock from late last year, last quarter's earnings results were not affected by this negative factor. However, it would threaten CPF's net profit in the next two or three quarters, and its gross margin would shrink from last year.
We derive 2014 fair value of GGM, 1.80-times price to book value, 15.8-per-cent long-term return on equity at Bt28, implying limited upside. We recommend holding for dividends, which are paid twice a year.
Tourism
By Asia Plus Securities
Last week, the National Peace and Order Maintaining Council seized administrative power in the country in order to keep the political situation under control. There had been many violent confrontations in Greater Bangkok and other provinces that caused deaths and damage to people and property.
The coup has hit tourism, with tourists losing confidence. About 50 countries have already warned their citizens to be extremely cautious. If the political situation becomes violent, they might raise their outbound travel alerts, or more countries are likely prevent their people from going to Thailand, thus threatening visitor arrivals.
However, tourism would be able to rebound, provided the tension subsides to the point where a new government can be appointed or elected, and a clear explanation about the political situation is given to Thai and international tourists.
The political turmoil is expected to depress tourism only for the second and third quarters, which is the low season. After that, tourism is projected to rebound in the fourth quarter, or high season.
According to statistics, in the month that major political events take place, tourist volume tends to plunge drastically. Two or three months was usually needed to regain the confidence of tourists and revive tourism. During the September 2006 coup, tourists dropped by 20 per cent quarter on quarter to 979,000 in September, then increased in the fourth quarter of 2006. This is similar to the April 2009-10 emergency decree that took place in the off season. As the political turmoil has continued since the beginning of this year, foreign tourists are expected to fall short of last year's 26.7 million. In the first four months of this year, arrivals were down 5 per cent on year. We are now working on how severely the coup affects foreign arrivals.
The negative factor has been pressing hotel-tourism stocks. We reiterate "underweight" and recommend avoiding investing in this sector for a short while. Among the three companies under our coverage, Minor International (MINT) would be affected less by the political tension thanks to its diversified business. The hotel business in Thailand made up less than 20 per cent of its first-quarter income.
For Central Plaza Hotels (CENTEL), 50 per cent of its income comes from the food business, 40 per cent from hotels in Thailand and 10 per cent from hotels in Maldives. ERW would be affected the most, as over 90 per cent of its income is from the hotel businesses.
Banking
"Underweight"
By Asia Plus Securities
Nine commercial banks under our coverage, except Krungthai Bank (KTB), declared a summary statement of assets and liabilities as of April with outstanding loans after allowances for doubtful accounts at a net Bt7.24 trillion, growing slightly by 0.07 per cent month on month and 7.92 per cent year on year, which is still in line with fiscal-year net profit growth projected at 6.28 per cent. As April saw long holidays, loan demand was low.
The political unrest has also weighed heavily on consumer and investor confidence. Net loans, mainly car leases, at minor commercial banks such as Kiatnakin Bank (KKP), Thanachart Capital (TCAP) and TISCO have declined and become too weak to negate increasing repayment. New car leasing has dropped along with decreasing car sales, while used car leasing has been delayed to lower risk.
However, LHBANK's net loans grew by 1.5 per cent, the largest jump, mainly from corporate and housing loans. For major commercial banks, only Kasikornbank's net loans, mainly for short-term working capital, increased month on month, by 0.9 per cent.
Bangkok Bank's net loans stayed unchanged while Siam Commercial Bank's net loans fell by 0.5 per cent on month. Outstanding deposits, including funding for small banks, in January were B7.87 trillion, falling 0.71 per cent on month but growing 6.28 per cent on year. SCB, LHBANK and Bank of Ayudhya showed the strongest deposits.
Competition in deposit gathering has been sluggish. As a result of weakening lending, less money was needed for loan issuance.
We maintain our negative outlook on the sector's fundamental factors and profitability for the rest of the year. Though first-quarter net profit made up 25 per cent of the 2014 earnings forecast, only major banks have been strong thanks to diversified sources of income. Because the car leasing downtrend is likely to continue throughout the year, minor banks' interest income and fee income have contracted significantly.
Higher debt provisions would be needed as asset quality is likely to suffer.
Second-quarter earnings are expected to stay unchanged quarter on quarter in the best scenario. Core income, net interest income and net interest margins are expected to be affected by the interest rate cut in late March, while fee income is likely to drop as a result of decelerating loan issuance and the insurance business after the long holiday had passed. Second-quarter debt provisions are expected to stay as high as the first quarter. Normalised provisioning expenses have been raised already.
We reiterate "underweight" for banking stocks. Earnings per share growth for the year is expected at only 2.4 per cent. We still favour BBL (fair value @Bt197) with a 1.17 times price to book value and good resistance to the economic crunch, as well as TISCO (fair value @B47.31) with an over 6-per-cent annual dividend yield. |CPF Plc                                                                                                                                           |2014-05-26 |      1282|

The Nation
Major retailers including Central Group and The Mall are expanding into several high-potential locations, particularly in the border provinces and tourism cities, to cash in on next year's implementation of the Asean Economic Community, which will attract more customers.
The AEC will likely increase regional economic prosperity and stability as well as bring new business opportunities, they believe.
Suthichart Chirathivat, vice chairman of the board of the Central Group of Companies, said he did not expect any significant change in the domestic retail market due to the AEC, which will be fully effective next year.
"The local retail sector has reached maturity as the big local players have fully penetrated the market and gained a high competitive advantage over foreign retailers. However, the implementation of the AEC will allow major local retailers to penetrate new markets in other AEC countries," he said.
Suthichart said this was the right time for Central Group to expand its retail business abroad, especially in countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia, as well as Europe.
"We may phase out our retail business in China as we are facing tough competition from local operators, and focus on other markets instead, such as those in the AEC and Europe."
Tatiya Sorsothikul, managing director of Seacon Square, said the full implementation of the AEC would drive a rapid increase in the number of foreign tourists coming to Thailand.
Low-cost airlines are quite popular at this moment and this has driven strong growth in the number of tourists travelling around Asean. Travel costs are coming down quite significantly.
"Seacon Square will be cautious when launching any new retail project. We will not focus on gaining market share, but profit. That is quite different from major retail players that need to expand their projects continuously to maintain market share," Tatiya said.
He said that during this time of political and economic uncertainty, it would be quite difficult to make new shopping malls perform well, as construction costs were getting higher. It takes longer for return on investment, about 10 years compared with seven or eight years previously. Many big players have seen the need to list on the stock market to issue property funds.
Supaluck Umpujh, vice chairwoman of The Mall Group Co, said that in 2015, Thailand's participation in the AEC would herald a major change in the country's position as a leading regional shopping hub and top tourist destination. There are 10 Asean member countries, totalling 600 million in population.
The improved infrastructure, transport facilities and airports in key Thai cities are expected to increase inbound tourism from 25 million to 40 million people within the next five years. The destination cities include Bangkok, Phuket, Pattaya, Hua Hin and Chiang Mai among others.
Dr Chatchai Tuangrattanapan, director of the Thai Retailers' Association, said it would take up to five years after next year's AEC implementation for the real effect to be seen.
"Based on my trips to several countries in Asean such as Malaysia and Singapore, I believe that less than 50 per cent of their people are concerned about the coming of the AEC," he said.
Chatchai said the AEC would allow a free flow of trade as import duties for particular goods would be cut.
However, there are many negotiations, such as those concerning the service sector and human resources that have yet to be finalised.
He said he did not think any drastic change would hit the local retail industry when the AEC kicks off next year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |Retail giants set growth strategy under the AEC more opportunity seen in border provinces and tourist sites                                       |2014-05-26 |       598|

The Nation
in a stern move to tighten security, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) yesterday said that any offence against the monarchy and national security would face prosecution in military courts.
The offences are those cited in Articles 107-112 of the constitution and include lese majeste.
Articles 113-118 cite other security offences, including talk of secession and insurrection.
Any violation of the NCPO's orders would also be tried in military courts.
NCPO order No 37 exempts offences committed in areas where the Internal Security Act and the emergency decree are in effect from being tried in military courts. In such cases, the offences would go through the normal judicial process.
Army chief General Prayut Chan-ocha will be given a royal command, appointing him as the head of the NCPO, and a ceremony will be held at 10.49am today at the Royal Thai Army headquarters on Rajdamnoen Road. A press conference will be held later to announce the NCPO's roadmap and the likely set-up of a national legislative assembly to push ahead with a new constitution and a national council for reforms.
The NCPO last night summoned more than 30 prominent individuals, including businessmen Land & Houses president Anant Asavabhokin, ItalianThai Development president Premchai Karnasuta, and Sansiri president Srettha Thavisin.
Academics allied with the anti-Thaksin protesters, including Suraphol Nitikraipot, the former rector of Thammasat University, and critic Thirayuth Boonmee, as well as the Banjerd Singkaneti, the dean of the Faculty of Law at the National Institute of Development Administration, were also summoned.
The NCPO said it would take legal action against Thaksin Shinawatra's lawyer Robert Amsterdam over his interview to the foreign press, in which he said some states had offered to Thaksin to host a government in exile, Army deputy spokesman Colonel Winthai Suvari said. The content of the interview was deemed as disturbing the peace in Thailand, so the NCPO would ask the Foreign Ministry to cut the lawyer's communication channels, he said.
Meanwhile, key community figures summoned for talks by the coup-makers have not been tortured and will not be detained more than seven days, NCPO spokesman Col Winthai said. However, the period of detention would depend on the degree of importance of the individuals and the information they had to give, he added. Winthai said the NCPO had summoned leading individuals from all sides of the political spectrum to inform them about the current situation.
Many of the summoned figures were detained but the military said they were being treated well and would be released in a few days when the situation had calmed down.
"They are not chained or tortured. We treat all of them with honour," Winthai said. "We have informed them of the need for cooperation to help solve the country's problems."
Winthai said many of the summoned persons had been released and some were freed on the first day. He said if detainees were wanted on arrest warrants, they would be handed over to police for further prosecution, which would begin tomorrow.
Regarding summoning the Shinawatras, Winthai said that the name of Khunying Potjaman na Pombejra, the ex-wife of Thaksin, was on an unofficial list. The spokesman said he still did not have information as to when former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra would be released, and he did not know whether NCPO chief General Prayut would hold talks with Thaksin.
Thaksin yesterday wrote on his Twitter microblogging page that the NCPO must return happiness to Thais.
He said he was sad that another coup had happened in the Kingdom and added that conflicts in the country stemmed from divisiveness and the lack of fair rules.
On Saturday night, troops escorted Panthongtae Shinawatra, the son of Thaksin, to his Bangkok residence, Winthai said.
The NCPO spokesman said Panthongtae was staying in Chiang Mai when he was summoned for talks with officials "to set aright his understanding". Later he was taken to his Bangkok residence "in line with his wishes".
People who reported to the NCPO at the Army's auditorium in the Thewes area yesterday morning were transported to an unidentified military camp around 3pm.

Thai Optical Group (TOG) expects its sales to grow 8 per cent to Bt1.8 billion this year.
However, Thai Optical managing director Wirach Pracharktam said that Thailand's largest publicly traded maker of optical glasses might book a lower profit this year, although that could be offset by the baht depreciation. Although TOG earns 95 per cent of its revenue from exports, Wirach said foreign customers might cut their orders in the wake of last week's military coup if they were not confident the company could deliver lenses to them on time.
In an exclusive interview with The Nation, he said: "Many overseas customers make inquiries. If they aren't confident, orders won't come because they can switch the orders elsewhere."
To enhance the confidence of its buyers, Wirach said that TOG would create a larger inventory for some lens products and for some products that couldn't be stored, it would develop a contingency plan with the cooperation of logistic companies.
TOG has three major product categories: standard lenses, premium lenses (such as progressive, photochromic and high-impact resistant lenses) and RX prescription lenses.
For prescription lenses, the company applies an online system that connects to eyewear stores in Australia and New Zealand and allows real-time ordering from end-customers, including for custom-made lenses, with delivery within 5-7 days.
"Since we are at the middle of the supply chain, we have no control on demand," Wirach said.
"We manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts to ensure the most efficient production. Because of this, supply chain communications are very important for us."
Domestic nosedive
TOG is largely an original equipment manufacturer that sells its lenses to lens distributors, labs, retailer and other lens manufacturers in many countries including Specsavers, an international optical chain operator that has a 25 per cent share of the company.
However, Wirach said domestic sales, which had shrun dramatically since the fourth quarter last year, might improve during the rest of this year.
In the domestic market, TOG sells some lenses to a local distributor that resells them to Better Vision, an eyewear chain.
Both the local distributor and Better Vision are wholly owned by the Pracharktam family, which has more than a 50 per cent share of TOG.
Wirach said there was a possibility of "vertical integration" but it was not included in the current plan.
TOG has set a modest target to grow 5-7 per cent over the coming years. However, growth can be increased if the company can develop new value-added products, Wirach said.
He said the company achieved a big jump in net profit during the first quarter due to baht depreciation and a cost-efficiency improvement programme. A consultant hired by the firm had found a lot of room to improve efficiency.
"We can increase production capacity by 30 per cent without having to invest significant money and reduce costs by 8 per cent this year, provided we can find outlets for the additional outputs," he said. From January to March, TOG booked sales revenue of Bt484.7 million, up 27.69 per cent year on year, and net operating income of Bt66.9 million, up 295.29 per cent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |Thai Optical                                                                                                                                      |2014-05-26 |       543|

The Nation's senior reporter Pravit Rojanaphruk yesterday morning reported to the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) and has been moved into custody to an unidentified military base.
Nation Multimedia Group editor-in-chief Thepchai Yong called on the military junta to respect freedom of expression and the right for people to have access to information.
"Especially in times of crisis like this, people's access to information is very important. And the media have a crucial role to play in keeping the public informed through free and independent reporting," he said.
Thepchai said he strongly supported the call by Thailand's major media organisations for the junta to repeal all the orders issued in the aftermath of the coup that were restricting media freedom.
He also urged the military to refrain from actions that were seen as intimidating the media.
Separately, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand issued a statement calling on the military government to respect freedom of expression and a journalist's right to work freely. It called for the release of detained journalists and the lifting of media restrictions.
On Saturday night, Pravit received a summons telling him to report at the NCPO by 10am yesterday.
Upon arriving at the Army's auditorium, he spent a few minutes giving an interview to foreign media while a few friends offered moral support.
Pravit then went inside the agency's compound with a lawyer and an officer from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who went inside to observe and returned about an hour later but didn't speak to the media. Neither Pravit nor his lawyer have been available for comment since then.
The journalist was among of group of people summoned to report yesterday who were transported from the compound in vans at about 3pm.
Meanwhile, the NCPO will allow free-to-air television channels, radio and satellite stations and cable operators to broadcast normally after the situation returns to normal.
But 14 satellite stations that are deemed to present clearly biased information will remain off the air unless they guarantee the broadcasts will not create public confusion or disturb peace and order.
Army deputy spokesman Colonel Winthai Suvari yesterday said the NCPO had responded to calls by media organisations for the junta to allow the media to carry out its duties in accordance with their ethics and responsibilities.
Winthai said community radio stations that faced the axe because they did not possess an operating licence would not be allowed to resume broadcasts unless they got a licence from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunica-tions Commission.
The NCPO yesterday called 19 print editors to a meeting to discuss the direction of news coverage in an "abnormal situation".
Meanwhile, US State Depart-ment deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf issued a statement saying the US is increasingly concerned about actions the military has taken just a few days after it staged a coup.
"It has dissolved the Senate, detained a number of people, called in some academics and journalists, and continued to restrict the press. We again call on the military to release those detained for political reasons, end restrictions on the media, and move to restore civilian rule and democracy through elections," the statement said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |The Nation reporter taken into custody NMG editor-in-chief calls on military junta to respect freedom of expression                               |2014-05-26 |       565|
|9143 |   9143|The US, the UN and the EU have all trotted out the same hoary old arguments about the need urgently to restore civilian rule in Thailand, hold a general election at once, etc. They seem to have the same speech prepared for crises anywhere in the world. The US in particular is hypocritical. President Obama will huff and puff and cancel the odd military contract. But he is surely not stupid enough to abandon Thailand and allow China to step up its influence in Asean.
None the less, it would help the Thai junta's image abroad if it paid more attention to public relations. The martial music and songs on blank screens were a mystery to foreign tourists and needed at least to have some commentary in English. Spokesmen for the Army should try to avoid statements which won't be believed, for example that red-shirt leaders are in custody so that they can "relax". Moreover, it is not a good idea to suggest, as one Army spokesman did, that "democratic mistakes" have led to this military intervention.
It is sad but true that most tourists in Thailand are currently judging the coup on their inability to get a drink after 10pm. It would certainly be a step in the right direction if tourist areas such as Pattaya could be exempted from early closing. I sense that foreigners there would put up with a tank at the entrance to the Walking Street just as long as their thirst could be satisfied.

Don't write us off just yet
Against the background of gloom and doom, no pleasant words about Thailand can be expected from overseas and there will be worse to come from Thaksin's hired foreign lawyers and publicists.
However, one respected credit-rating agency, Fitch Ratings, says that the coup d'à¹‰tat is not itself a "negative trigger", the focus of concern instead being on its aftermath and whether reforms will be speedy in laying down transparency and anti-corruption measures in our political and economic system. Oddly, there is now a great chance of Thailand getting good corporate governance that could be a surprise to our Western friends and the envy of our Asean neighbours. Or, we could repeat the old pattern of a power-mad regime that is even more corruptible than before.
In the meantime I would ask all foreign observers not to write us off just yet. Watch, wait and see.

Academics, parochialism hinder progress
For over eight decades Thailand has only ever known conflict and political instability. The country has never enjoyed truly democratic governance where the law is administered fairly and enforced apolitically in the interests of all.
The most recent government, finally deposed by yet another military coup, was completely self-serving and totally undemocratic in nature. In the interests of the country as a whole such a regime, remotely controlled, had to be eradicated. It clearly resisted reform for the betterment of the country. Remaining in office would have only subjected Thailand to more of the same chaos and kleptocracy.
The coup d'etat was inevitable. Initially, save for a few misguided protests, armed violence has been stopped and peace achieved. In this patriotic totalitarian situation, reform can be instituted.
Currently we see civil rights organisations, Amnesty International, the US and many Thais protesting the imposition of military rule and calling for a "return to democratic governance". Presumably they mean the government which has recently been deposed. The cause of the coup would seem to be considered better than what could result from the coup: a country purged of the perpetrators of criminal behaviour with a democratic system established.
Foreign interference from academics and others via press releases (mostly emanating from Robert Amsterdam), parochialism from the Thai press and a general lack of understanding and appreciation of the current historic situation, have replaced armed violence and corruption as Thailand's greatest enemies. Thais now face a test of their patriotism and their will to achieve sound governance for the future of their country.
Only the discipline of the military can save the country from its historical instability and exploitation of the people.

The Nation
The Finance Ministry has invited 32 state and private banks to bid for the first phase of a three-year programme of bridge loans totalling Bt50 billion to pay rice farmers still owed under the pledging programme. The first Bt30-billion tender will be called early next month.
Pongpanu Svetarundra, deputy permanent secretary of the ministry, said those financial institutions interested in joining the bidding would be required to offer a minimum of Bt2 billion.
He said the ministry would open bidding for a term loan worth Bt30 billion on June 6, and a second tender for the remaining Bt20 billion on June 13.
After former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra dissolved the House of Representatives late last year and the government took on a caretaker role, which was prolonged by the failure to elect a new government in February, it was unable to raise all of the tens of billions of baht it owed farmers under the pledging project.
Accelerating these overdue payments to more than 800,000 farmers has been identified as a priority of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), as the military junta now calls itself. It says it will try to clear the books within a month.
As it will take some time for the Finance Ministry to borrow the Bt50 billion under its latest tender offer, the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) announced that it would ante up Bt40 billion to get some of the farmers paid in short order.
Luck Wajananawat, managing director of the BAAC, said this amount would come out of the bank's own farmers' relief fund.
"The bank believes that the remaining farmers will all be paid within a month," he said.
Luck said that while waiting for the Bt50 billion to be borrowed by the Ministry of Finance, the BAAC would begin to disburse an amount not exceeding Bt40 billion so that the payments could start right away.
This operation would be guarantee by the ministry.
According to the BAAC, as of last Friday, of a total of 1.67 million contracts under the rice-pledging scheme worth Bt192.95 billion, the bank had paid off 833,182 contracts worth more than Bt100 billion.
Special task force
Meanwhile, the Commerce Ministry's permanent secretary Srirat Rastapana said it would set up a special task force, on which a representative from the NCPO would sit, to inspect rice stocks and warehouses nationwide.
A source in the Finance Ministry said its auditing committee had found that about 3 million tonnes of rice had disappeared from the stockpiles.
The junta's decision to accelerate payment of farmers long owed money under the pledging programme could help stimulate the country's economic growth to 3 per cent this year, says the Thai Chamber of Commerce.
After a meeting of the chamber's regional boards in Bangkok yesterday, TCC vice chairman Somkiat Anuras said the Bt92 billion in payments to farmers would help boost confidence in the economy.
"The total payment of Bt92 billion that will be soon provided to farmers will boost economic growth by about Bt300 billion to Bt400 billion this year. As a result, the economy could grow by 3 per cent this year, higher the previous expectation of 1.5 per cent," he said.
Somkiat said a survey of members during the weekend found that the business sector had more confidence in future growth, despite the impact on the economy due from a half-year of political turmoil.
To draw up plans for an economic road map, the chamber and the Board of Trade of Thailand are to hold a meeting of their members and seven other business organisations today. (May 27). The meeting's conclusions will be proposed to the junta.
Somkiat said TCC members largely shared the view that cross-border trade would be a key economic driver this year amid uncertain overall export and tourism growth.
Asked about concerns about foreign investors' confidence, Somkiat said this was the time to manage the mess the country found itself in. He expects that more confidence will be seen after Thailand solves its internal problems. He believes the NCPO will do this and reform the country in various aspects including politics, government, the economy and education.
According to the chamber's survey, about 76 per cent of respondents had a gloomy economic outlook for this year because of the impact from political turmoil in the first half. However, most had a better outlook for future growth.
Viroj Jiratikanchote, chairman of the TCC's committee on economic development of the Northern region, said the northern economy would see slow growth this year due mainly on the impact of the earthquake on the tourism sector. The tourism industry is expected to see this year's revenue decline by Bt4.6 billion, or 4.6 per cent, from the previous forecast of Bt94.6 billion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |Finance seeks Bt50-bn term loans to pay off rice farmers 32 banks invited to bid for first tender of Bt30 bn under 3-year programme               |2014-05-27 |       792|
