## Introduction

Do newspaper articles that are published before and after the occurrence of a regime transition differ systematically in terms of their topic coverage and content? Utilizing an original dataset containing all political news published from 2013 to 2015 by _The Nation_, an English-language daily newspaper in Thailand, this project explores the relationship between regime transition and the media. Specifically, I analyze Thai newspaper articles that were published under democratic rule (pre-May 2014 coup) and those that were published under military rule (post-May 2014 coup), using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to examine topic variation amidst a regime transition. Then, leveraging the topics generated by the model, I conduct a series of quantitative content analyses for assessing the frequencies of words and measuring the sentiments associated with a given topic over time.
