## Introduction
Elite theory has evolved out of a fundamental contradiction—few are able to dispute the existence of a superior stratum elevated above the rest of society, yet many are unwilling to accept the proposition that such stratum wields disproportionate amount of control and influence over the exercise of political power. To subscribe to both propositions is to acknowledge that human society is not only stratified but also dominated by a select few. This is the stance taken by some elite theorists, whereas others are more reluctant to do the same. After all, what is at stake is nothing less than the principle of equality and the belief that such principle can be realized through the abolition of classes and private ownership or through democratic political institutions. Elite theory is therefore highly provocative given its potentially consequential implications, yet it is also haunted by its own profoundly pessimistic conclusions about the possibility of an equitable social life under current or future political order.

In this paper, I examine how the development of the elite theory literature reflects different ways in which elite theorists have confronted with the reality of stratification and the possibility of domination in society. Stratification, on the one hand, implies the demarcation of structural and symbolic boundaries which reinforces as well as naturalizes actual or perceived differences across social groups. Domination, on the other hand, describes a chronic pattern in which the relationship established between socially differentiated groups empowers one group to thrive at the expense of another. The scholarly attempts by elite theorists to problematize and reconcile this remarkable affinity between stratification and domination have produced a shared domain of analytically diverse scholarly inquiry which usefully captures both dynamics without reducing one to the other. Elite theory therefore remains an indispensable analytical tool for understanding how the dialectical processes of stratification and domination unfold and can unfold differently under a range of historical and institutional conditions. Furthermore, the lack of definitional and conceptual consensus over the notion of elites permits fruitful theoretical and methodological divergences, allowing scholarly debates surrounding the role that elites play in modern society to fragment and evolve in ways that are meaningful and applicable to a wide range of political analysis today.
The paper focuses on the development of four lines of debate which not only remain fundamentally unresolved but also contain important implications for current and future theorization of stratification and domination. These include the central debates over (1) psychological and the technical/institutional basis of power, (2) class domination and elite domination, (3) elite unity and elite disunity, and lastly (4) the process through which democratic procedure produces inequality versus the process through which inequality becomes benign via democratic procedure.

## The Development of Elite Theory
The purpose of tracing the development of elite theory is not to provide a comprehensive overview of what has been said about elites by a range of theorists we associate with the literature, however loosely connected. Rather, it is to explore why the literature developed the way it did by highlighting how certain analytical trends and theoretical issues become more central than others at different junctures. As such, this paper considers the sequence in which the literature developed as a broader trajectory informed by a series of underlying debates over four central issues. This thematic approach is intended to provide an assessment of the elite theory literature in ways that capture the central debates which have prompted elite theorists as well as other theorists to engage in theoretical considerations of stratification and domination regardless of where they stand on these issues.

According to many accounts, classical elite theory emerged as an attempt to develop a set of law-like theoretical propositions with universal validity in response to Marxism (Mosca 1896; Pareto 1901, 1916), providing the analytical building blocks with which powerful critiques of representative democracy could be formulated, extended, and expressed in novel ways (Michels 1911; Hunter 1953; Mills 1956; Kornhauser 1959). Yet, the same theoretical foundation built for negating the notion of a classless society and the creed of liberal democracy could not fully withstand the challenges posed by the pluralist conception of democracy (Aron 1950; Dahl 1958, 1960; Meisel 1958). These developments, I argue, reflect an ongoing theoretical dialogue over four major issues concerning the sources of elites’ superior position in society, the nature of elite domination, the degree to which elites cohere, and the extent to which political institutions can moderate or reinforce elite rule over time. I proceed to analyzing how the development of elite theory is formed around these central issues one by one.

## Sources of Elites’ Superiority in Society 
How do elites become distinguished from the rest of society? Are the sources of their supremacy economic, psychological, technological or institutional? These questions have been raised throughout the development of the elite theory literature, yet it remains inconclusive whether elites derive their superiority from the essential role they play in society or merely from innate attributes. Such interest in the constitution of the elite as a distinctive social category can be traced all the way back to classical elite theorists who, far from attempting to denying the uniqueness of elites, were very much invested in demonstrating that social stratification and elite formation constitute a universal phenomenon. For classical elite theorists such as Mosca and Pareto, formulating a theory which clearly singles out the elites as a group distinguished in every way from other members of society is central to their attempts to refute the prevailing axioms of Marxism. Yet, it remains unclear how such attempts have motivated Pareto and Mosca to establish theoretical claims of elite distinction in the way that that they did. For the purpose of this analysis, therefore, their critiques of Marxism serve as a more useful analytical starting point than their theoretical formulations of elites for which they are renowned. This is not to say that such critiques can be considered in isolation of elite theory but rather that they provide the much-needed contextualization of elite theory in its early stage as a deliberative theoretical project designed to accomplish a specific task.
	Mosca’s attack on Marxism can be summarized as an attempt to debunk the economic determinism implied by Marx’s conception of historical materialism and, by extension, the professed inevitability of a revolution that will usher in a classless society. In demonstrating through empirical analysis that political change cannot be explained solely on the basis of prior changes in the modes of production, Mosca writes,
  > The error of historical materialism lies in holding that the economic factor is the only factor worthy of consideration as cause, and that all other factors have to be regarded as effects…It seems altogether absurd to regard as mere effects, and never as dignified, respectable causes, the political doctrines and religious beliefs which constitute the moral foundations of state organisms. Penetrating deep down into the consciousness of ruling classes and masses alike, they legitimize and discipline, command and justify obedience, and they create those special intellectual and moral atmospheres which contribute so greatly toward determining historical circumstances and so toward directing the course of human events.
