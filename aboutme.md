Hello! My name is Napon Jatusripitak. I am a PhD student in Political Science at Northwestern University. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how political elites generate, secure and maintain political power by means of distributing and allocating material benefits to groups or individuals in society, legitimately or otherwise. This blog is where I test-run some of my ideas, try my hand at coding, and show the world my kind of social science.
